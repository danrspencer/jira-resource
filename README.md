Behavior
--------

### `out`: Creates, updates and transitions a Jira ticket

#### $TEXT

The `summary`, `fields` and `custom_fields` can be either a string value, or an object with `text` / `file` fields. If just the `file` is specified it is used to populate the field, if both `file` and `text` are specified then the file is substituted in to replace $FILE in the text.
   
e.g. 

```yaml
description: An awesome ticket
-------
description:
  file: messages/this-will-be-the-description
-------
description:
  text: |
    Substitute text into this messaage
        
    $TEXT
  file: messages/jira-message
```

#### $NOW

If a date field needs to be populated with a date relative to current time `$NOW` can be used. The datetime can be modified relative to the current date.
 
e.g.
```

$NOW
# One hour ahead
$NOW+1h
# Yesterday
$NOW-1d
```

_KEY_
* `years	y`
* `weeks	w`
* `days	d`
* `hours	h`
* `minutes	m`
* `seconds	s`

#### Parameters

* `summary`: *required* The summary of the Jira Ticket. This is used as a unique identifier for the ticket for the purpose of updating / modifying. As such it's recommended you include something unique in the summary, such as the build version.
```yaml
summary: Ticket Summary
-------
summary:
  text: Build v$FILE
  file: version/version
```
* `issue_type`: The issue type for the ticket
```yaml
issue_type: Bug
```
* `fields`: A list of fields to be set with specified values
```yaml
fields:
  description:
    text: |
      Routine Release
            
      $FILE
            
      _Generated by Concourse_
    file: messages/jira-release-notes
  environment: Prod
  duedate: $NOW+1h
```
* `custom_fields`: A list of custom fields to update. The id and value are used to update the custom field. The property title doesn't matter, it's purpose is to make the pipeline yml more understandable.
```yaml
custom_fields:
  this_text_doesnt_matter:
    id: 10201
    value: Something
```        
* `watchers`: An array of usernames to be added as watchers to the ticket
```yaml
watchers:
  - dave
  - amier
  - lauren
```
* `transitions`: An array of string values for the ticket to be moved though. The transitions are conducted in the order specified.
```yaml
transitions:
  - Submit
  - In Dev
```
 
#### Order of execution

When executing the Jira job the ticket is updated in the following order:

* Search for existing issue matching `summary` given
* Create ticket / update ticket
* Add watchers
* Perform transitions

If you need to perform actions in a different order, for example, transitions before adding watchers then multiple jobs are required.
 
 e.g.
 
```yaml
# Create ticket and Submit
- put: jira
  params:
    issue_type: Change
    summary:
      text: Site v$FILE
      file: version/version
    transitions:
       - Submit
# Add a watcher then move to in dev
- put: jira
  params:
    summary:
      text: Site v$FILE
      file: version/version
    watchers:
    - dan
    transitions:
    - In Dev
```
